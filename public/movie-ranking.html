<h3>Dune 2</h3>
<p>Unbelieveable film, have to stick with Dune 1 to really apreciate the second film.<br/>
9.5 on IMDB says it all.</p>
   <h3>Crash</h3>
   <p>Has you hooked from the get go. Plenty of twists and turns.<br>
   one for the soul.</p>
   <h3>Gladiator 2</h3>
<p>Not as good as the first but still an amazing watch. 
   espically on the projector with a cheese board.</p>
