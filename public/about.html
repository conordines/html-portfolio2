<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Conor Dines, a hiking enthusiast who loves hitting the trails and soaking in nature’s beauty—though let’s be honest, the best part is the well-deserved beer afterward!</p>
  <p>As a budding web developer, I'm diving into the world of coding with the same enthusiasm I have for a steep climb.
  When I’m not coding or conquering mountains, you can find me at home wrangling my two lovable troublemakers, Floki and Rogaire. They keep me on my toes—mostly because they think my snacks are way more interesting than their dog treats!</p>
<p>Remember, life is like a hike: sometimes you just have to take a step back, appreciate the view, and laugh at the moments you trip over a twig!</p>
